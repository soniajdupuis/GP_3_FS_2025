    "# Mini-project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The mini-project can be carried out in teams of 2. To start the project select an area of interest (AOI) between the ones available:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Alps\n",
    "- Norway:\n",
    "    - JuvasshÃ¸i (Glacier)\n",
    "    - Finnmark (larger dataset)\n",
    "    - Karasjok\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derive LST from raw brightness temperatures and compute a timeseries at several points of interest (POIs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Select one AOI and download the data for it.\n",
    "2) The goal is to create two different land surface temperature (LST) time series for two distinc point of interest (POI) within the selected AOI.\n",
    "    - Select two different points (pixel or several pixels). For example:\n",
    "        - one point in a valley and one on top of a mountain. Can you for example observe temperature inversions ?\n",
    "        - points belonging to a different land cover (glacier/non glacier). What kind of differences do you expect ? What can you observe?\n",
    "        - two points on distinct glacier location, maybe at different elevations. If you choose to work with a glacier, for how many days were the temperatures above 0 degrees during one year. Do you see changes accross the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> you are free to choose any points/ location, but you have to explain why you choose these points. Explain briefly what differences you expect to see. E.g., if you choose two POIs with different land cover, what differences do you expect in terms of LST? Or points at different altitudes, what differences in the time series do you expect ? Anything else? \n",
    "\n",
    "=> One POI *can* be an average of several pixels (as showed in notebook #2, for example a 3x3 pixels zone) in order to reduce the cloud cover, but the area has to be homogeneous. I.e you have to proove that the area is homogeneous before doing it. For example by plotting the land cover in this area, or google earth, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Creation of two time series of LST in one selected location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time series *can* be composed of monthly means or daily means (examples in notebook #2). Again if you choose to use means, shortly explain why and similarly if you decide to not use any average, exaplin why.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each time series has to cover at least two years.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2\n",
    "**Compute daily temperature cycles**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For your POIs compute daily or annual land surface temperature cycles as shown in notebook #2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computation of **daily** LST cycles plots for different seasons or different months at one POI (two different plots) \n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computation of mean annual LST cycles for two different POIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Explain why you choose a certain option, a certain season and describe the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time serie comparison of AVHRR and MOIDS at one selected point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Compare MODIS and AVHRR data at one POI (one comparison plot). The MODIS data are available from the\n",
    "ESA CCI toolbox (see notebook #03)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What can you say about the differences? Describe the differences and explain why there are differences if any. If both time series are similar, explain why they are similar. Did you expect something different? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The final outcome should be a clean and running notebook with comments explaining all your steps and analysing the plots.\n",
    "All three tasks have to be realised."
